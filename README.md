![](https://github.com/joncto/Jon-Fosse-Heatmap/blob/main/FossePros_heatmap_web.png)

This heatmap shows the geographic distribution and density of theatre productions assosiated with the Norwegian dramatist Jon Fosse (mainly as a playwriter or translator).

The data is provided by the National Performing Arts Archive of Norway (sceneweb.no) and collected by Jens-Morten Hanssen, Section Manager for Books and Languages at the National Library of Norway.

The map is produced in QGIS and exported using the qgis2web-plugin and OpenLayers' JavaScript libraries for web maps.
