# The Jon Fosse Heatmap
This is a web-readable heatmap showing the geographic distribution and density of theatre productions where the Norwegian playwriter Jon Fosse has been mentioned as playwriter or translator.

The data is provided by the National Performing Arts Archive of Norway (sceneweb.no) and collected by Jens-Morten Hanssen, Section Manager for Books and Languages at the National Library of Norway.

The map is produced in QGIS and exported using the qgis2web-plugin and OpenLayers' JavaScript libraries for web maps.
